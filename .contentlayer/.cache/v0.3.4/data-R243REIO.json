Our research into the matter has revealed that people growing up in this digital age face more anxiety and stress compared to past generations. Part of the problem was revealed to be society's reliance on social media for digital communication.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that social media can, and does, have a negative impact on the mental health of people if used in an unhealthy way. So, my group sought to address these issues by creating a new kind of social media app, one that promotes positive interactions between people who live amongst a community.\n\nOur vision was that HowRu serves as a bridge back into the past by providing the denizens of the internet with the authentic community-centred experience of the past while maintaining the convenience and speed of digital communication.\n\n## How to Visit\nUse the link at the bottom of the page to access the hosted webapp!\n\nYou will need to create an account before you can access HowRu and experience the app for yourself.\n\n## Contributors\nHowRu was developed by first semester BCIT students Bavneet Dhillon, Raymond Xie, and Will Otterbein (me).",

There are four levels in total each containing three to four different keys.\n\nTo control the player, simply use the WASD keys. The player has the ability to sprint, this can be done by pressing the space key while moving. At anytime, the game can be quit by pressing the escape key. To see these controls ingame, press the 'r' key.\n\nThe levels are labrynthian in nature, inspired by the old-school gameplay to be found in titles such as Wolfenstein and Doom. Unfortunately, there are no enemies to defeat in KeyFinder, the only contest is the one going on inside your mind as you navigate the levels eagerly seaking keys.\n\nOnce you reach the final level and unlock the last chest, you will have successfully completed the game.
