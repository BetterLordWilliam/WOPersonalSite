The project was completed over approximately 1 month and was composed of several smaller assignments.\n\nThe creation of this game was an exercise in object-oriented design and was assessed with the Object-Oriented programming paradigm in mind by my course instructors, who awarded the final project a 100% score.\n\nThis program is a very simple simulation of life. There are four types of life forms which populate the board. These life forms are: Plants, Herbivores, Carnivores and Omnivores.\n\nAs might be guessed, Herbivores eat Plants, Carnivores eat herbivores, and Omnivores eat Plants. All organisms can breed, given that their unique requirements for empty space and breeding partners are met.\n\nIf you are curious as to the inner workings of The Game of Life, please view the source code via the GitHub link at the bottom of the page.\n\n## How to Run\nVisit the links bar at the bottom of this page to find a link which will take you to a download mirror. Enjoy!\n\n*Java is required to be able to run this project.*",
