## About the Project
HowRu is a mental health focused social media app. The app provides users with a means of achieving genuine connections with people in their community with features such as localised posting and a built-in messaging feature.

The idea stemmed from my group's concern about the well-observed decline in the mental health of younger people, who have all grown up on social media. Our research into the matter has revealed that people growing up in this digital age face more anxiety and stress compared to past generations. Part of the problem was revealed to be society's reliance on social media for digital communication.

It has been demonstrated that social media can, and does, have a negative impact on the mental health of people if used in an unhealthy way. So, my group sought to address these issues by creating a new kind of social media app, one that promotes positive interactions between people who live amongst a community.

Our vision was that HowRu serves as a bridge back into the past by providing the denizens of the internet with the authentic community-centred experience of the past while maintaining the convenience and speed of digital communication.
