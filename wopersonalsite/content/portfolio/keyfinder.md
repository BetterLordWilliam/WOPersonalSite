## About the Project
KeyFinder was a game that I created with Java back during the end of 2022 and during the start of 2023. The project took approximately 3 months to fully complete due to a busy school schedule, but in March of 2023 I made the last official changes.

The creation of this game was an exercise in object-oriented design as well as a test of my knowledge of programming concepts such as recursion.

## What to do
In the KeyFinder game you are the key finder, a character who must collect keys to open locked doors and access the final purple chest of each level. There are four levels in total each containing three to four different keys.

To control the player, simply use the WASD keys. The player has the ability to sprint, this can be done by pressing the space key while moving. At anytime, the game can be quit by pressing the escape key. To see these controls ingame, press the 'r' key.

The levels are labrynthian in nature, inspired by the old-school gameplay to be found in titles such as Wolfenstein and Doom. Unfortunately, there are no enemies to defeat in KeyFinder, the only contest is the one going on inside your mind as you navigate the levels eagerly seaking keys.

Once you reach the final level and unlock the last chest, you will have successfully completed the game. Congratulations! From here you are free to play again by pressing 'enter' or quit the game by pressing the 'esc' key.
