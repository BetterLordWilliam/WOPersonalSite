## About the Project

The Game of Life was an assignment created with Java during my second semester at BCIT. The project was completed over approximately 1 month and was composed of several smaller assignments.

The creation of this game was an exercise in object-oriented design and was assessed with the Object-Oriented programming paradigm in mind by my course instructors, who awarded the final project a 100% score.

This program is a very simple simulation of life. There are four types of life forms which populate the board. These life forms are: Plants, Herbivores, Carnivores and Omnivores.

As might be guessed, Herbivores eat Plants, Carnivores eat herbivores, and Omnivores eat Plants. All organisms can breed, given that their unique requirements for empty space and breeding partners are met.

If you are curious as to the inner workings of The Game of Life, please view the source code via the GitHub link at the bottom of the page.
